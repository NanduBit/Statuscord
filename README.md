## üîß Known Errors And Fixes

### [Discord] Status is not changing
> Just wait for a few minutes. It takes some time for Discord to refresh your status.

### [Discord] Invalid Token Error
> Make sure you have copied your token correctly. It should be a long string of characters. Follow the token obtaining guide again if needed.

### [Discord] Cloudflare Error/Temporarily banned from accessing Discord's API
> This happens because some hosting platforms have Shared Public IP Addresses. Whenever Discord sees lots of invalid requests coming from a single IP address, it will use Cloudflare to temporarily block any incoming requests.

> Fix:
> - Restart your hosting service
> - Wait for a while before trying again
> - Consider using a different hosting provider
